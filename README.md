# Support_DisplayKeybinds
works in centerprint, bottomprint, and server messages (not clientCmdChatMessage)

## Usage
To display the keybind bound under this keybinds Name
<br>
`` <key:keybindName> ``
<br>
or, preferably
<br>
`` <key:division:keybindname> ``
<br>
since there can be overlapping keybind names
